# Pattern-Seek v0.1.0

**Release Date:** 2025-04-02

## Summary

- Initial release of Pattern-Seek, a command-line utility for pattern-based searching in text files.
- Release to Github for cloning, local use, and contributing.

## Added

### Core Pattern Matching

- GUID/UUID detection (8-4-4-4-12 hexadecimal format, with/without hyphens)
- Email address detection
- Date detection (ISO format, US format, European format, text formats)
- URL detection (http, https, www prefixes)
- IP address detection (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Text search (whole word, case sensitive, case insensitive)

### File Search Capabilities

- Single file search
- Multiple file search
- Directory search
- Wildcard pattern search (e.g., *.txt)
- UTF-8 encoding support

### Output Features

- Colored terminal output
- Pattern-specific color coding
- Match highlighting
- Line number display
- Context line display (configurable)
- File path display for multi-file searches

### Command Line Interface

- Pattern type selection
- Context line configuration
- Color toggle option
- Help documentation

### Error Handling

- Graceful file access error handling
- Invalid pattern type validation
- Appropriate exit codes

## Implementation Notes

- Comprehensive test suite for all features
- Test-driven development approach
- Proper type annotations
- Detailed code documentation

## Notes

### Learning

- Pre-compiling regex patterns add a small performance improvement to search.
- UTF-8 encoding is good enough to handle most real-world file processing.
- Pattern complexity varies significantly. For instance, IP address/date patterns could require more tuning.
- Color coding different pattern types enhances readability.
- Using MIT License for the project. Useful links:

### Known Limitations

- Large files may experience performance degradation.
- Date pattern matching is syntactic only; does not validate for semantic correctness (e.g. will match Feb 30)
- URL pattern only recognizes URLs with common prefixes (http://, https://, www., etc.)
- No processing for binary files (this is probably a non-issue)
- Regex patterns are couple break with edge cases.

### Future Improvements (TODOs)

- Add other pattern types (phone number, credit card, SSN, etc.)
- Performance optimizations for large files
- Add file type filtering
- Add output format options (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Custom regex patterns beyond built-in patterns
- Progress indicators for large file/directory searches
- Search history and results caching
